                <p>Happy Birthday to a truly remarkable person! You are like a steady flame, always there to light up the darkest of days and warm the coldest of hearts. When life feels like a storm, you are the gentle umbrella that shields her, never faltering, always steadfast. 
                 Your care is a soft breeze on a hot day, effortlessly cool and refreshing, yet never distant. We are both so incredibly grateful for your presence in her life. Youâ€™ve been the quiet strength she can lean on, the laughter that brightens her every moment, 7
                 and the cool, calming presence that brings balance to her soul. Wishing you all the love and joy today, because you truly deserve it Lee!</p>
